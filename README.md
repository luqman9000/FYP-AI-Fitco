Finding a suitable exercise can be difficult for some people because not all exercises are suitable for everyone and having a coach can ease people on how to do exercise. This problem can be solved by developing a smart fitness mobile app to assist users. The app will be using MLKit pose detection and will be using MLKit pose detection built using Python and Java programming language and SQLite in Android Studio. The result is a complete app that users can follow the exercise program recommended by the app based on the user’s BMI in front of the phone’s camera. The BMI will be categorized into three categories, underweight, normal, and overweight. There will be 2 sessions of exercises for each BMI category. The user then must follow the app’s program by doing exercises in front of the user’s phone camera. Finally, the progress data will be saved in the database and the user will be able to view the list of saved progress.
